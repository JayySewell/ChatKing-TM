# ChatKing AI - Secure Deployment Guide

## 🔒 Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in ChatKing AI and provides guidance for secure deployment.

## 🔐 API Key Security

### ✅ Security Measures Implemented

1. **No Hardcoded Keys**: All API keys are loaded from environment variables
2. **Secure Validation**: Keys are validated without exposing actual values
3. **Masked Logging**: API keys are masked in logs (e.g., `sk-or****9090274`)
4. **Environment Isolation**: Separate configurations for development/production
5. **Key Rotation Ready**: System supports easy key rotation

### 📋 Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Core AI Services (Required)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here

# Security (Required)
JWT_SECRET=your_64_character_jwt_secret_here
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_encryption_key_here

# Optional Services
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret_here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8888
```

### 🔧 Getting API Keys

1. **OpenRouter**: Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and create an API key
2. **Pinecone**: Create account at [pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io) and generate API key
3. **Brave Search**: Get API key from [Brave Search API](https://api.search.brave.com)
4. **Google OAuth**: Set up at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
5. **SendGrid**: Create account at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) for email services

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Set all required environment variables
- [ ] Validate API keys are working
- [ ] Run security check endpoint
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify content filtering

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Enable audit logging

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify all services are healthy
- [ ] Test critical functionality
- [ ] Monitor security scores
- [ ] Set up key rotation schedule
- [ ] Configure backup systems

## 🔍 Security Validation

The system includes built-in security validation:

```bash
# Check configuration status
curl -X GET /api/admin/config-status

# Run security check
curl -X GET /api/admin/security-check

# Validate environment
curl -X GET /api/admin/validate-environment
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### API Key Compromise
1. Immediately rotate the compromised key
2. Update environment variables
3. Restart the application
4. Monitor for unusual activity
5. Review audit logs

### Security Incident Response
1. Check security monitoring dashboard
2. Review system logs
3. Implement temporary restrictions if needed
4. Document the incident
5. Update security measures

## 📈 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
- Weekly: Review security scores and recommendations
- Monthly: Rotate API keys and secrets
- Quarterly: Security audit and penetration testing
- Annually: Full security architecture review

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Security score (target: 95+)
- Failed authentication attempts
- Content filter violations
- API rate limit hits
- System performance metrics

## 📞 Support and Updates

For security updates and support:
- Monitor the repository for security patches
- Subscribe to security advisories from API providers
- Maintain updated documentation
- Regular security training for administrators
